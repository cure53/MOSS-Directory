# MOSS-Directory
A listing of projects which have received awards from the [Mozilla Open Source Support (MOSS) program](https://www.mozilla.org/moss/) and people who sit on the MOSS committees. MOSS broadens access, increases security, and empowers users by providing catalytic funding to open source technologists. MOSS currently has three funding tracks: 1.) Foundational Technology; 2.) Mission Partners; and 3.) Secure Open Source (SOS). 
* This repository is a work-in-progress and is not yet a complete listing of all MOSS projects
* Projects are listed in individual files by Track and are ordered by the year in which the award was given
* Reports and change/fix logs for the SOS Fund can be found in the directory "SOS_Fund_Audits"
